# PyViz-homework

## Summary

This homework is not complete. The goal was to complete a working dashboard and I was unable to do so. Please grade accordingly. I will ask the instructor for further clarification prior to class tomorrow. This assignment breaks down the San Francisco real estate market using pyviz as well as as the built in matplotlib functions in python. In this assignment, the student is asked to use a combination of Pandas and Pyviz to visualize real estate data for the bay area. I was able to complete a partial portion of the extra credit as well.
