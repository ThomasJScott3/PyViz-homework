# PyViz-homework

## Summary

The goal of this homework to complete a working dashboard that displays insights into the San Francisco real estate market. It does this by using pyviz as well as as the built in matplotlib functions in python. I worked with both my tutor and the instructor to get the dashboard to display properly, but was not able to display it in my jupyter lab. I was able to complete a partial portion of the extra credit as well. The dashboard panels are organized by type. In order to navigate the various visuals, simply select the tab denoting the visual type. 

Bottom line: I worked with both the instructors and a tutor to make the dashboard work and was still unable to do so. Please grade accordingly.
